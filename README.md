# PythonPractice

### Practice code
* I mainly solved a few of the problems that were fun in this website: https://codingbat.com/python
  * Fun little brain/programming exercises - didn't post all since yanno lazy. I also would do the really quick ones only in the browser's interpreter.

### The YouTube Playlist Populater
This one is a rather simple idea, in a more complex program than 10 line puzzles.
So I have friends send me youtube links of songs they like over a Discord chat, then I clone the chat and rip all the links. From there I copy the links into a file for documentation and rip the Video ID's of each link to then insert them automatically into a playlist!

Been learning some python to get a little more into programming, I'm very much used to C/C++.
Some things I appreciate, since it allows me to write less code (always cool).
I also heard its good for automating tasks(thanks udemy ads), so thats what I've been messing with atm.

If you want to rip this code go ahead, I cannot stop you.
